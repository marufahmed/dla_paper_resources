# Process to calculate Intersection Over Union of Deep Learning Based Document Layout Analysis for the paper 'Optimum Deep Learning method for Document Layout Analysis in Low Resource Languages'

Resources


## Inference
- [Document Image Transformer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nielsr/dit-document-layout-analysis).
- [Layout LM](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nihalbaig/layoutlmv3_official_document).
- Custom Trained YoloV8 was inferred on local system

## Resize
To normalize the pixel values of images, inferred images were resized using [resize.ipynb](https://github.com/marufahmed/dla_paper_resources/blob/master/resize.ipynb).

## Annotation
To create the annotations for inferred predictions, [labelme](https://github.com/labelmeai/labelme) was used. The classes that were labeled are as follows:
- Paragraph
- Image
- Table

After annotating the inferred images, corresponding json files were created.

## IOU comparison
Individual & collective IOU comparison was measured using [iou_comparison.ipynb](https://github.com/marufahmed/dla_paper_resources/blob/master/iou_comparison.ipynb)
